# Welcome to my Github profile

I'm not sure why I'm doing this.

# My projects

I have an urge to create programming languages for some reason. I have published two here on Github, [one of which sucks](https://github.com/vitkozel/VKode) and the [other one is completely unusable yet](https://github.com/vitkozel/Lumeo).

## Full list of my public repos

* My own, totally useless **[Guam IDE](https://github.com/vitkozel/Guam-IDE)**
* Programming language **[Lumeo](https://github.com/vitkozel/Lumeo)**
* **[Lumeo Builds](https://github.com/vitkozel/Lumeo-builds)**
**[Guam IDE](https://github.com/vitkozel/Guam-IDE)**
