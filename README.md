# Welcome to my Github profile

I'm not sure why I'm doing this.

I can do Go, I can do C#, Python, HTML, CSS... VKode and Lumeo (joy emoji)

# My projects

I have an urge to create programming languages for some reason. I have published two here on Github, [one of which sucks](https://github.com/vitkozel/VKode) and the [other one is completely unusable yet](https://github.com/vitkozel/Lumeo).
